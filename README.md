Code for the Smoking Crystal Skull Instructable project: https://www.instructables.com/Smoking-Crystal-Skull/

Want to create the perfect set for a unforgettable Halloween party? Or add some uncanny atmosphere to a kidâ€™s room?

This fun interior decoration project describes how to create a Smoking Crystal Skull: a upsetting cloud of fog coming out of a terrifying translucent skull with breathing illumination.

The project requires some level of experience in electronics, programing and basic crafting with carton and cables. The cost is relatively cheap, well under $80, with standard components that can be sourced easily (see below). It took me a couple of evenings to create this Smoking Crystal Skull.

The brain that controls the Smoking Crystal Skull is a small ESP8266 processor module, similar to Arduino with Wifi capabilities. The internal fog is created by an ultrasonic mist maker covered with water. A fan ensures a dynamic air flow, on top of the pulsing illumination, coming from a waterproof led strip. All of that is enclosed in a translucent glass skull.

The Smoking Crystal Skull may also be used as a perfume diffuser, but make sure to include some pumpkin fragrances...
